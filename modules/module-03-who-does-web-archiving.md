## Overview and Objectives

### Overview: 
This week we will look at who is building web archives. This will include what institutions, their type, where they are located, and most importantly, what they are collecting. 

There are a couple of short videos as well as some readings that discuss who is involved in the web archiving process. 

There is a graded discussion for this module.

## Exploring Web Archives

Each week we will try and learn about a new web archive, a web archiving tool, or a web archiving service.  The goal of this is to get an introduction to what is happening in the web archiving space, what is being collected, and who is collecting it. 

This week we will look at the institutions and organizations that are using the web archiving service Archive-It. 

Archive-It - https://archive-it.org/ 

* List of Organizations - https://archive-it.org/explore?show=Organizations
* List of Collections - https://archive-it.org/explore?show=Collections

Take a look around these sites and explore two institutions in depth. You will report out on these institutions and their collections in this week's discussion.

## Discussion

### Discussion Post:

In at least one paragraph, discuss what you learned about who is involved in the web archiving space. What kinds of institutions did you primarily see? What kinds of collections did you see from these institutions? Are there areas (geographically) that you didn't see much activity from? Why might that be? 

In at least one paragraph per institution, identify which institution or organization you looked at in the Archive-It platform.  What kinds of content are they collecting? Did you notice any similarities with other organizations that you looked at?  Did you notice any differences in the kinds of things they collect? Please include links to the specific sites you reference including links into the web archives themselves. One of the goals of this course is to become comfortable with linking into web archives and making them an active part of your online experience. 

### Class Engagement:
After you have made the discussion post described above, take the time to response, comment, or engage with at least **two** of your classmates posts.  

If there are any unanswered questions feel free to try and offer an answer or suggestion to the original poster.  Did they mention something that made you investigate something further? If so, what was it?
