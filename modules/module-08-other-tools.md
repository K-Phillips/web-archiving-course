# Module Eight - Other Tools

## Overview and Objectives

### Overview:
The purpose of this module is to provide an overview of a number of tools for curation, characterization or profiling (to analyze and understand the captured content) and tools to widen access to collections and raise awareness for web archives.

This will build on concepts that you were introduced to in the previous technology modules. 

There are several readings, some online documentation to skim, and several power points that you will review. 

### Objectives:
1. Learn about additional tools in the web archiving landscape.
2. Become familiar with some of the standards in development for enabling cross-archive access (Memento).
3. Experiment with ArchiveReady and familiarize yourself with the concept of archivability.

## Archiving Exercise

### Web Archiving Exercise - Archivability with ArchiveReady
This week we will look at the concept of archivability as it pertains to Web Archives. 

First, take a look at this paper by Banos, Kim, Ross and Manolopoulos. 

Banos V., Kim Y., Ross S., Manolopoulos Y.: CLEAR: a credible method to evaluate website archivability, iPRES 2013, http://purl.pt/24107/1/iPres2013_PDF/CLEAR%20a%20credible%20method%20to%20evaluate%20website%20archivability.pdf  

You don't need to read the article in depth, but it is helpful to get the context of the work. 

Next, navigate to http://archiveready.com  (sadly it is not an https service). 

![Alt](images/module-08-archiveready-01.png "Homepage for the ArchiveReady service.")

Get familiar with this service by browsing around the website.  

After you have looked around, choose the homepage of an organization or other website you want to test. 

Enter the websites URL into the provided box and choose "Check now". 

For this example I chose to look at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) website (https://ercot.com ). 

![Alt](images/module-08-archiveready-02.png "ArchiveReady results page for http://ercot.com")

Look at the different results tabs to get an idea of the different metrics and archivability facets. 

In this week's discussion you will share the website you chose for this exercise. Additionally, you will share the Overall ratings as well as a synthesis of the findings from the service. Any additional observations you find interesting about this service would be good to share as well.  Finally, explain how you think this kind of service could be helpful in the web archiving lifecycle.

## Exploring Web Archives

Each week we will try and learn about a new web archive, a web archiving tool, or a web archiving service.  The goal of this is to get an introduction to what is happening in the web archiving space, what is being collected, and who is collecting it. 

This week we will look at the Portugal National Web Archive (https://arquivo.pt/?l=en )

![Alt](images/module-08-arquivo.png "Homepage for Arquivo.pt")

What is Arquivo.pt - https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/help/what-is-arquivo-pt/  

Examples of preserved pages - https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/examples/examples/ 

Exhibitions - https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/examples/collections/ 

Youtube Channel for Arquivo.pt - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMJX0ICk1t2TzuNXghxKDg  

Some things that I would like for you to notice is the different ways of presenting web archives.  The style of the wayback interface that they are presenting is different than others we have seen so far in this course. A description of the differences would be useful in your discussion post. The service also presents some examples and exhibits to help users get into the web archives a little better.  How well does this work in your opinion? What did you end up exploring in the archive? How well does arquivo.pt present content in Portuguese and English.  Have you seen other interfaces in multiple languages in our web archive exploration so far?

It should be of no surprise that the web archive focusing on the .pt domain and the national web of Portugal might not have the same content we are used to seeing here in the United States.  If you have trouble thinking about what to look at in the archive consider finding the url of a city in Portugal, a local sports team or other cultural event in Portugal and exploring what has been archived

## Discussion

### Discussion Post:
In at least one paragraph, discuss what you learned this week about other tools and service in the web archive landscape. What were some of the terms or concepts that were new to you this week? What are some things that still need clarity for you? How do you think a protocol Memento and its associated technologies can benefit the web archive landscape?

In at least one paragraph, describe what happened when you used the ArchiveReady service service. What was the website you chose for this exercise? What was the Overall rating that this website received? Discuss the findings from the service in addition to this overall score. Any additional observations you find interesting about this service would be good to share as well.  Finally, explain how you think this kind of service could be helpful in the web archiving lifecycle. 

Finally, in at least two paragraphs, discuss the Portugal National Web Archive arquivo.pt and what you learned about this web archive.  What are some differences you noticed in the presentation of web archives in this service compared to collections we have looked at in previous weeks. Share your observations of the examples and the exhibitions and share your opinions about if that helped in exploring the collection.  Finally what are some of the websites that you explored in arquivo.pt?

### Class Engagement:
After you have made the discussion post described above, take the time to response, comment, or engage with at least **two** of your classmates posts.  

If there are any unanswered questions feel free to try and offer an answer or suggestion to the original poster.  Did they mention something that made you investigate something further? If so, what was it?
