# Overview of a Weekly Module

This course is divided into modules that correspond to the weeks in the semester. 

There are fourteen modules in total starting the first week of class and ending the last week of the semester. 

Each week there is an **_Overview and Objectives_** which gives you an idea of what is going to be happening in this week's module. 

The **_Readings_** page will list the required and optional readings for that week.  In addition to traditional readings, there are videos and sometimes audio recordings for you to listen to. 

A feature of each module called _**Exploring Web Archives**_ is included to give you a bit of a guided introduction to the wide range of web archives and collections that exist around the world. These explorations are generally a part of the weekly discussion. 

Finally, in each module there is a **_Discussion_** related to the topics covered that week. Additionally, the web archives you explored in the Exploring Web Archives section will come back as part of the weekly discussion.

Generally the current week's module and the following week's module will get published for those that like to work a bit ahead.  The graded discussions are opened on Monday morning the module week.

# Discussion - Introduce Yourself

This is a pretty standard first discussion for an online course. 

In a paragraph or two introduce yourself, where you are from, what program you are in, and your progress in that program. 

Try and share some things about yourself that will allow me and your classmates to get to know you a little better. 

If possible, include a picture so that we can include a face with a name in the discussions.
