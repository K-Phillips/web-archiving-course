# Module Nine - Collection Policies

## Overview and Objectives

### Overview:

The purpose of this module is to show how collection policies, collection scopes, and general selection activities occur in the scope of building a web archive. Web archiving is at its lowest level another tool for building collections in libraries and archives.  In order to communicate the scope of these collections with others some sort of collection scope or policy statement can be useful. 

This will build on concepts that you were introduced to in the technology modules and start to align them with other concepts in the library and archives space. 

There are several readings, some online documentation to skim, and several power points that you will review. 

### Objectives:
1. Familiarize yourself with different web archive collection policies.
2. Understand the role that web archives can play in the collecting and acquisition of materials in libraries and archives.
3. Install and use the ArchiveWeb.page tool for creating web collections locally.

## Readings

### General

The readings this week were selected to give you an introduction to the collection development approaches that are common to building collections using web archiving tools and techniques.  These readings are a combination of both theory and practice in this space. You will be introduced to the framework we will use for the next major assignment in the Murray & Hsieh piece.

### Web Archive Collection/Collecting Policies

A selection of policies for web archive collections at different institutions around the US.  This is only a sample of those that are easily identifiable. You should notice the scope and breadth of the different plans. In this weeks' discussion you will select one of these to describe, or ideally, find a policy from another institution not listed here for the discussion.
