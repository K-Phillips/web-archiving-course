# Assignment 2: Web Archive Tools Critique

## Context:
The purpose of the Web Archive Tools Critique is to learn to critically evaluate technology tools and services related to the web archiving process. The assignment is designed for you to share your observations about an existing tool or service related to the broad practice of archiving the web. These observations will include who is responsible for creating the tool/service, what problem is it trying to solve, are there other tools in this space that do something similar or different, what are the costs (if any) associated with the tool, and how users generally interact with the tool (service, software that is run locally, browser plugin, tool requiring a server). 

## Assignment:
Identify an existing tool used in the web archiving space. I suggest starting with the “Tools and Software” section of the Awesome Web Archiving list from the IIPC (https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving), but if you have another tool or service in mind that isn’t on that list feel free to use it, the tool just has to be related to the overall web archiving process.  Once you select the tool/service, explore the documentation/website for that tool/service to get a good idea of what problem it is trying to solve, and other information about the creation of the tool/service. 

While it isn’t strictly required, I suggest you pick a tool or service that you are able to download, create an account with, or generally use as part of your assignment. I couldn’t imagine writing about a tool I am not able to see, test, or use in any sort of believable way and you will find this assignment much easier if you pick something you can actually test.

In this assignment it is important to include links to relevant web pages and documentation related to the tool that supports your observations. 

## Organization and Content:
The assignment should start with the title “Assignment 2: Web Archive Tools Critique” centered at the top of the first page. 

The analysis should have the following section headings: Introduction, Problem Space, Technology Requirements, Assessment, and References.

### Introduction
Provide an overview of the web archive tool or service that you have selected.  This should include information about the tool itself, the motivation for creating this tool or service, and a brief description of what this tool or service does.  Other useful information to include in the introduction is who is responsible for this tool?  How long has this tool or service been around? What kind of software license does it have? What are the costs involved with using this tool? 

### Problem Space
Provide a discussion of why this tool or service exists.  What is the problem space that this tool or service was created for? Go into more detail than in the introduction about what the tool or service actually accomplishes. How does this tool help to solve or minimize the issues in the problem space.

### Technology Requirements
Describe the technology requirements for using this kind of tool or service. Is it designed to be downloaded and run on a desktop or run as a server? Is it a hosted service that requires an account and a subscription? What kinds of environments is the tool able to be installed, Windows, Linux, Mac? If you have a chance to install the tool and try using it, what experience did you have in the process? 

You should also include any information (and links) related to online documentation for the tool or service. Does the tool or service have an online mailing list for help? Is there a help forum?

### Assessment
Discuss the overall observations of the web archive tool or service that you chose. Would you recommend this tool for others to use? Do you think that it solves or minimizes the problem it exists to solve? Does it seem like the tool is still maintained and in use? What is the size of the user community of the tool? Is there enough documentation available to get the tool installed and working? Are there things that would make using the tool easier that you would suggest to the project owner? 

### References

Any references cited within the document. Use APA standards for citations. Use an online source (Purdue OWL) for specifics about APA.

## Layout Specifics: 
2-3 pages of textual content (1000-1500 words), font-size 11 pt, double spaced with 1 inch margins throughout the document.  

The title for the assignment should be centered horizontally at the top of the first page (just like this document). Sections should be bolded and slightly larger than the 11pt font used in the rest of the document.  I suggest using the Headings available in most word processing tools. 

Feel free to include screenshots as needed to provide examples or highlight points.  Don’t try to fill up space with the screenshots, if they make your document a bit longer than three pages that isn’t a problem. 

Use APA standards for citations. Use an online source (Purdue OWL) for specifics about APA.

Put your last name in the upper right margin.  Include pagination in the bottom margin. 

Name the document Assignment2_lastname.docx, Assignment2_lastname.doc, or Assignment2_lastname.odf depending on which tool you use. You will submit this to the **Major Assignment: Web Archive Tool Critique** in Canvas.
