# Assignment 1: Web Archive Critique

## Context:
The purpose of the Web Archive Critique is to explore a web archive and describe what you observe. The assignment is designed for you to share your observations about an existing web archive, including the organization responsible for creating the archive, the scope of the collection, any quality or performance issues you find, and finally to discuss options that might improve the experience with the collection. 

## Assignment:
Identify an existing web archive.  This could be one that you have encountered in the course so far or it can be something you discover on your own.  The readings and exploring web archives portion of Module Three would be good places to start to discover potential web archives.  Once you select the archive, explore the collected websites to get a good idea of what is or isn’t collected as part of the archive. 

For this assignment, choose a topical web archive.  Instead of The Library of Congress Web Archives you would choose one of the archiving initiatives they have.  Likewise if you look at an Archive-It collection, instead of choosing an institution, which might have multiple projects, you are better off choosing a more topical, or event focused web archive.

In this assignment you will be describing a web archive. It is important to include links to content within the web archive that support your observations.

## Organization and Content:
The analysis should have the following sections: Background, Scope, Quality, Closing, and References.

### Background

Provide an overview of the web archive that you have selected.  This should include information about the collecting organization, the motivation for creating this web archive, and any technical information that is available about the building the collection. 

Other questions that are good to think about (though might not apply to all collections) include:
When was the collection created? Why was it created? Does it expand upon an existing physical collection or support a program of study or scholarship at that institution? Who is responsible for the creation of this web archive? Is it a single institution or a collaborative project? What tools/platforms were used in the creation of this web archive? Is it an ongoing collection or has it completed? How are users expected to find this web archive? How is it cataloged or described?

### Scope
What is the scope of the content being collected? Does it focus on a specific event or is it based around a topic or subject? Does it contain specific kinds of websites like political websites or election websites? Does it contain websites from a specific period of time? 

Just as important as what is included, what doesn’t seem to be included in the archive?

### Quality
Describe the overall quality of the captured websites in the archive.  Are there types of content that don’t seem to display or render in the playback tool very well? Does most of the content display correctly? If there are specific websites or website features that don’t seem to display well, discuss that in this section. Include links to examples that demonstrate the issues you identify whenever possible. 

### Closing
Discuss the overall observations of the web archive you chose. Discuss observations you would give the collection creators given the opportunity. Provide any suggestions for additional content that might be missing from the collection. 

### References
Any references cited within the document.

## Layout Specifics: 
2-3 pages of textual content (1000-1500 words), font-size 11 pt, double spaced with 1 inch margins throughout the document.  

Feel free to include screenshots as needed to provide examples or highlight points.  Don’t try to fill up space with the screenshots, if they make your document a bit longer than three pages that isn’t a problem. 

Use APA standards for citations. Use an online source (Purdue OWL) for specifics about APA.

Put your last name in the upper right margin.  Include pagination in the bottom margin. 

Name the document Assignment1_lastname.docx, Assignment1_lastname.doc, or Assignment1_lastname.odf depending on which tool you use. You will submit this to the **Major Assignment: Web Archive Critique** in Canvas.
