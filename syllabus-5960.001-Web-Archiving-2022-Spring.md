## Course Description
The web is a fundamental component of nearly all modern interaction. Preserving content from the web and providing long-term access to preserved content presents an interesting set of challenges for Information Scientists. In this course, you will develop knowledge and skills related to the standards, tools, and processes of web archiving. You will learn the mechanics of web archiving and its relation to familiar concepts like collection building and appraisal, access and use, and ethics. This course will provide hands-on experience working with different projects and tools, and is designed for anyone interested in the topic without any need for prior experience in web archiving.

## Objectives
By the end of this course you should be able to:

* Discuss the role and the potential of the Web as information and characteristics of the Web for archiving and preservation. 
* Be familiar with tools and appropriate techniques for preservation of different aspects of the web including “standard” websites as well as a working understanding of preserving API-based web content like social media sites.
* Recognize the challenges of Web archiving.
* Become proficient at using, interpreting, and explaining common playback tools such as the Wayback Machine.
* Increase your awareness of legal and policy constraints on Web archiving.

## Required/Recommended Materials 
This course does not have a required textbook but will instead rely on a wide range of resources such as reports, articles, white papers, conference proceedings, presentations, and video recordings.  A full list of readings is available in LEARN as weekly modules. 

Every effort has been made to select resources that are either open access or resources that are available to you as a student from the UNT Libraries, which are paid for by your library fee. If you have any trouble accessing the readings do not hesitate to reach out to me for assistance.
